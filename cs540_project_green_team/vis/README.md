This directory contains the Python code for our visualizer, i.e., the main
program that draws what the system is doing (and maybe allows for other
interactivity we may decide to add).

This code requires [pyglet](https://bitbucket.org/pyglet/pyglet/wiki/Home) version 1.3.2.  Install with:

	pip3 install pyglet

Run the program with:

	python3 main.py
